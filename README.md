# Driving vs Behaviour Interactions in Delhi's Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS)
This study investigates the Delhi Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) to analyse the conflict between its rigid infrastructure and the region's fluid, non-lane-based driving culture. The research demonstrates that while the BRT improves bus performance, it does so at a significant cost to other motorized vehicles.
A microscopic traffic simulation of the Siri Fort intersection was developed in SUMO, calibrated with empirical data on traffic volume, signal timings, and vehicle parameters. The model employs the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and SL2015 lane-changing model to simulate agent behaviours, including 'normal' and 'aggressive' driver profiles, across low, medium, and high traffic flow scenarios.
Results reveal that the BRT system structurally disadvantages general motorized vehicle (MV) traffic, causing performance degradation even at low flows. Critically, at medium traffic volumes, the system reaches a tipping point, leading to a catastrophic, system-wide failure for MV traffic, while a non-BRT configuration remains congested but functional. The study also finds that aggressive driving offers only marginal benefits at near-capacity conditions and is futile in gridlock, demonstrating that infrastructure design and traffic volume are the dominant factors determining system stability.
The failure of the Delhi BRT was not an indictment of bus priority itself, but an outcome of a design incompatible with existing traffic demand. These findings underscore that for BRT systems to succeed in contexts with high-volume, heterogeneous traffic, they must be implemented with complementary measures to manage mixed-traffic flow and prevent systemic collapse.
